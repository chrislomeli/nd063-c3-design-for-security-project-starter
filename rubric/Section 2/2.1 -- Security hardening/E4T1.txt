As a Cloud Architect, you have been asked to apply security best practices to the environment so that it can withstand attacks and be more secure.

Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- security group on web server instance should not allow ssh access to public, or only from specific internal sources
- a vpc endpoint and/or a WAF could be programmed to recognize and deny 
- Reduce the number of authentication attempts permitted by a connection in the sshd_config file
- Remove the password access in the sshd_config file f

Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised 
how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- s3 buckets should be encrypted
- s3 buckets should be private, not public
- allow s3 access only to the application itself, perhas via a vpc endpoint
