E1T4.txt - Text file identifying 2 poor security practices with justification.

Issues:
0 - The VPC Network ACL is open
1 - The ELB has security group that allows for all inbound HTTP traffic on ports other than 5000
2 - The Web Service Instance - C3 EC2 instance has a security group that allows all traffic - and also explicit open access for SSH and HTTP -- it should allow requests only from the ELB
4. The private subnet is not used, but is configured to be able to route to the (public) internet gateway  -- 
5. The Web Service Instance Flask service has access to environment variables for both the free and secret recipie buckets, but only needs the free bucket
8. There's no monitoring
9. No WAF
10. Management plane should be in a separate AWS  account
